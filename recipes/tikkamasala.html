  <h2>Easy Chicken Tikka Masala Recipe</h2>
  <p></p>
  <p>This easy chicken tikka masala is the perfect recipe for when you are craving bold and strong flavors on a weeknight!</p> 
    <p>Tender pieces of chicken thighs marinated in yogurt and ginger and then simmered in a flavorful creamy tomato curry with coconut milk.</p> 
     <p>Make sure to have extra naan on hand to sop up the delicious sauce!</p>

     <p></p>
      <h3>Ingredients List</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Chicken Thighs: Boneless and skinless chicken thighs is ideal for chicken tikka masala. Chicken thighs have more fat making the meat more tender compared to chicken breast. </li>
        <li>Plain Yogurt: Yogurt tenderizes the chicken and gives it a great tangy flavor. Use a plan yogurt without any added flavors. Either Greek style yogurt or regular yogurt will work.</li>
        <li>Aromatics: Shallots, ginger and garlic are used in the sauce. The ginger and garlic is also used in the yogurt mixture to marinate the chicken.</li>
        <li>Chopped Tomatoes: To keep this recipe even easier, use canned chopped tomatoes and for added smoky flavor, use fire-roasted chopped tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Tomato Paste: I like using tomato paste that comes in a tube when you only need a few tablespoons. Saute the tomato paste into the oil to give the whole dish a touch of sweetness.</li>
        <li>Spices: Turmeric, paprika and garam masala are the spices used to make the tikka masala so flavorful. A pinch of cayenne is optional but adds a nice touch of heat.</li>
        <li>Coconut Milk: Instead of heavy cream, which is traditionally used in garam masala, coconut milk is added. Look for full fat coconut milk which will have more fat and flavor than lite coconut milk.</li>
        <li>Sugar: Adding sugar is optional but as you taste the sauce, you may want to add a touch of sugar to bring out the sweetness of the other ingredients. Use a teaspoon of brown sugar or white sugar.</li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Steps to follow:</h4>
     <ol>
       <li>Add the chicken thighs to a bowl along with yogurt, ginger, garlic and garam masala and mix to combine so all of the chicken pieces are evenly coated. Marinate while you prep the other ingredients or for at least 30 minutes.</li>
       <li>Bring a wide skillet over medium-high heat and sear the chicken pieces until golden brown on both sides, then set aside.</li>
       <li>In the same skillet, saute the chopped shallots, ginger and garlic until fragrant.</li>
       <li>Add the tomato paste and spices and saute for another minutes.</li>
       <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and water and mix to combine. Simmer for 5-10 minutes and taste for seasoning. Add sugar is you prefer more sweetness.</li>
       <li>Pour in the coconut milk and sir to combine. Then add the cooked chicken back in and stir so all of the chicken is coated with the sauce.</li>
       <li>Continue simmering for another 2-3 minutes then remove from the heat.</li>
       <li>Garnish the tikka masala with chopped herbs and serve with cooked basmati rice and naan.</li>
     </ol>>
